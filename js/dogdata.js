Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of Edward II and Henry VII, who both had packs of Glove Beagles, so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove, and Queen Elizabeth I kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood 20 to 23 cm at the shoulder. Small enough to fit in a "pocket" or saddlebag, they rode along on the hunt.<br><br>Not only is the Beagle an excellent hunting dog and loyal companion, it is also happy-go-lucky, funny, and thanks to its pleading expression cute. They were bred to hunt in packs, so they enjoy company and are generally easygoing. There are two Beagle varieties: those standing under 13 inches at the shoulder, and those between 13 and 15 inches. Both varieties are sturdy, solid, and 'big for their inches,' as dog folks say. They come in such pleasing colors as lemon, red and white, and tricolor. The Beagle's fortune is in his adorable face, with its big brown or hazel eyes set off by long, houndy ears set low on a broad head. A breed described as 'merry' by its fanciers, Beagles are loving and lovable, happy, and companionable all qualities that make them excellent family dogs. No wonder that for years the Beagle has been the most popular hound dog among American pet owners. These are curious, clever, and energetic hounds who require plenty of playtime.`,

The pups are born white, and the spots develop a few weeks after birth. The Dalmatian stands 19 to 24 inches (48 to 61 cm) tall at the withers and weighs 45 to 70 pounds (20 to 32 kg)<br><br>Although dalmatians are known for their striking spotted coats, they are actually born completely white and develop spots from two to four weeks old. Their beautiful markings are easily recognisable and are usually black or brown, however, they can also appear lemon, blue or brindle.",
        "contentTitle2": "Treatment",
        "contentText2": `Dalmatians are so high energy they need a minimum of two hours of exercise every day. This needs to be done in at least two walks, ideally with a chance to run in a secure area. On top of this, your Dalmatian will need plenty of playtime, free time in a secure garden and training sessions to keep their brains active.<br><br>Obesity can be a significant health problem in Dalmatians. It is a serious disease that may cause or worsen joint problems, metabolic and digestive disorders, back pain, and heart disease. Though it's tempting to give your pal food when she looks at you with those soulful eyes, you can "love her to death" with leftover people food and doggie treats. Instead, give her a hug, brush her fur or teeth, play a game with her, or perhaps take her for a walk. She'll feel better, and so will you!`,
